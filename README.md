Q1 : Perfect Number using recursion only
Write a java program to find all Perfect numbers between 1 to n using recursion.

Perfect number is a positive integer which is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors.

For example: 6 is the first perfect number
Proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3
Sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
Hence 6 is a perfect number.

Q2 : Convert Octal to Hexadecimal number system using recursion only
Example
Input octal number: 175
Hexadecimal number: 7D

Octal number system
